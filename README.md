## About the Speaker

[Ceora Ford](https://ceoraford.com/) is a software engineer based in Philadelphia who is currently learning Python and Cloud. She is also a learner advocate at Egghead.io. During the summer, she teaches at Kode With Klossy and BSD Education.

## Why should you listen to Ceora?

Ceora have failed at learning plenty of times in the past, who wrote an [article](https://dev.to/ceeoreo/5-mistakes-i-made-my-first-year-learning-to-code-3cj5) about her mistakes she made in her first year of learning how to code. She has done a lot of research about this topic. This talk will be based on a combination of her research and personal experience.

## Why is this relevant to you?

- Tech industry is always changing so there's always something new to learn.
- You will gain better foundational knowledge.
- You will waste less time.
- You will retain information for the long term.
- You will become a better teacher.

## Learning Tips

### Tip #1: Focus

**Focus on one topic at a time to gain in-depth knowledge.**
There are so many technologies to learn and it can be tempting to learn them all at the same time.

**Focus on a few learning materials at a time.** Don't bog yourself down with using too many resources. This could lead to not making any meaningful progress and not having a substantial grasp of the information.

**Learn in a distraction free zone.** Turn off notifications on your phone and put phone across the room. Listen to white noise playlist on YouTube.

### Tip #2: Pomodoro Technique

It is the workflow of working or studying for 25 minutes and taking a 5 minute break.

> What makes the Pomodoro Technique so special?

**It helps us tackle procrastination.** Having a 5 minute break at the end of work session tricks your brain into looking forward for a reward. This technique helps us deal with procrastination which is a huge barrier for getting things done.

**It creates focused and productive study sessions** which can help you get more in-depth knowledge in less time.

### Tip #3: Take breaks

**Take short breaks** during study sessions to help your brain synthesize information in the background. Adding some light physical activity into your breaks, like taking a short walk, leaves a positive impact to your brain.

### Tip #4: Get Rest

**Don't skip out on sleep** to get more studying done and avoid cramming materials. Our brain do so much work in the background while we are sleeping which is very beneficial. Get enough rest for how many hours that works for you, but do not miss out on sleep.

### Tip #5: Take Good Notes

- Only highlight key information.
- Put information into your own words to help you truly understand what you are learning. Do not just copy and paste.
- Handwritten notes over typed. This is a preference from Ceora but do what works for you.
- Use illustrations and metaphors to bring abstract topics to a human level that is more relatable.
- Use active recall to retain information better by repeated testing in different time intervals.
- Do what works for you in terms of learning style.

### Tip #6: Apply What You Learn

**Make a direct application** of what you're learning by building projects. Building a small project is a good way to start and to not be intimated as it can be built overtime.

**Be active in learning** by coding along with the video course you are watching to retain information much more. Learning by doing is a powerful technique.

### Tip #7: Learn In Public

- Write articles about what you are learning and post it on your blog or on [DEV](https://dev.to/).
- Live coding. Stream while you code on platforms like Twitch.
- Share what you're learning on social media like on Twitter through #100DaysOfCode.

### Tip #8: Do the hard stuff

1. Try to solve hard problems.
2. Take a break.
3. Try again.
4. Ask for help on Stack Overflow or Tech communities on Twitter.

### Tip #9: Be Consistent

**Practice consistently.** Start small by coding 30 minutes a day or for 3 days a week.

Try [#100DaysOfCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/) challenge which helps you build a habit of coding everyday and helps you hold accountable to a huge, supportive community.
